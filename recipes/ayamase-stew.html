    <li>In a clean Pot, add the Palm Oil, cover it up and let it heat up on low to medium heat until the color of the Oil turns to honey-brown color.</li>
    <li>At this point, don't open the lid of the pot because of the intense smoke, just turn off the stove and leave it to cool or simply lift it outside for a faster cooling.</li>
    <li>Once the Oil is cooled down return to the stove top and let it heat up a little bit not to smoking point (uncovered this time )</li>
    <li>Add the diced Onions and locust bean and fry till the onions begin to float on the Oil.</li>
    <li>Pour in the boiled pepper, stir it all together, cover it up and allow it to cook until the oil begins to float over the pepper sauce.</li>
    <li>Add your choice of Meat, some beef stock to loosen up the sauce if it's too thick and Salt to taste.</li>
